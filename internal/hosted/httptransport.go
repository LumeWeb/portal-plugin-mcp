// ErrCredentialsNotConfigured is the sentinel a CredentialResolver returns
// when it has NO credential source configured (yet) — as opposed to
// ErrNotAuthenticated (assembly.ErrNotAuthenticated), which means a source
// exists but the request carries no identity. The credential middleware
// treats it as "no resolver in force": the request passes through
// unauthenticated (services fall back to the config token) exactly as it
// would when no resolver was installed at all. Any other error (or a blank
// token) keeps failing closed with a 401.

// withCredential stores the resolved Portal API JWT in the context. It is the
// single way identity is injected for the current request; it delegates to the
// shared mcpplane/credctx leaf so the HTTP boundary and the (plugin-side)
// transfer services read and write the same credential from a context.

// pass-through, preserving the local config-token fallback.
//
// FAIL CLOSED: when a resolver is configured, a resolver error or a blank
// resolved token rejects the request with 401 before it reaches the MCP
// handler. It must never fall through unauthenticated — the embedded catalog
// ops and transfer services fall back to the config default token when no
// per-request credential is injected, so letting the request continue would
// dispatch an unrecognized (or attacker) caller under the deployment's own
// shared credential. The resolver is the ONLY identity source on the hosted
// path: identity is established by the fronting OAuth/Portal middleware, not
// by local config.
